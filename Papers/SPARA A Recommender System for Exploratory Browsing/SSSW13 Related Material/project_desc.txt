Exploratory browsing is a very hot topic in the Linked Open Data community (and more generally in the Semantic Web community). Currently, there are tons of tools for visualizing and browsing RDF datasets that exploit the graph-based structure of the underlying model. Unfortunately, very often such tools are not suited for exploratory tasks aimed at recommending/discovering new items/knowledge in a specific knowledge domain (e.g movies, music, etc.). In fact, they just allow the users to follow links (RDF predicates) without any explicit guide toward novel and sometimes serendipitous resources. The idea behind this miniproject is to build a browser for items in a specific knowledge domain (movies, music, etc.) which is driven by an underlying LOD-based CB recommender system. In this tool, the reccommendation task is supported by items browsing and, at the same time, the browsing is guided by the recommender system. The students may refer to [1] or [2] as examples of JavaScript-based implementation of a graph browser.

Pointers: A simple CB recsys can be built via a bunch of SPARQL queries to an endpoint. Once the similarity graph is ready it can be embedded in a visual browser implemented as shown in the two examples [1] and [2].
