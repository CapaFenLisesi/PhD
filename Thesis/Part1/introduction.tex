\chapter*{Overview of Part~\ref{part:dataset_profiling}}

In Part~\ref{part:hdl}, we first conduct a unique and comprehensive survey of seven metadata models: CKAN, DKAN, Public Open Data, Socrata, VoID, DCAT and Schema.org. Next, we propose a Harmonized Dataset modeL (HDL) based on this survey. We describe use cases that show the benefits of providing rich metadata to enable dataset discovery, search and spam detection.
