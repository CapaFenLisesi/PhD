\chapter*{Overview of Part \ref{pa:part2}}

As the Web of Data contains millions of RDF triples, consuming this knowledge can benefit various tasks such as enrichment, personalization and social analysis.
\\
\\
In Part~\ref{pa:part2}, we consume the Linked Data in event domain in order to create Semantic Web applications and to provide valuable solutions for personalization.
\\
\\
In Chapter~\ref{ch:web-app}, we present some Semantic Web applications that either support a friendly event browser interface or help create an event with consistent details. We highlight the limitations of existing technologies designed to access and use DF data by common Web developers.
\\
\\
In Chapter~\ref{ch:recommendation}, we propose a hybrid recommender system built on top of Semantic Web to make personalized suggestions of events. Such system faces a number of challenges due to the inherent complex nature of events.
\\
\\
In Chapter~\ref{ch:community-detection}, we propose an approach to detect meaningful communities in event-based social network (EBSN). We leverage the event-media links to construct networks based on event-centric users' activities in media platforms.
